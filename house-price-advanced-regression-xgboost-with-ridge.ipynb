It is the most stable solver, in particular more stable<br>  for singular matrices than 'cholesky' at the cost of being slower.<br><br>- 'cholesky' uses the standard :func:`scipy.linalg.solve` function to<br>  obtain a closed-form solution.<br><br>- 'sparse_cg' uses the conjugate gradient solver as found in<br>  :func:`scipy.sparse.linalg.cg`. As an iterative algorithm, this solver is<br>  more appropriate than 'cholesky' for large-scale data<br>  (possibility to set `tol` and `max_iter`).<br><br>- 'lsqr' uses the dedicated regularized least-squares routine<br>  :func:`scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr`. It is the fastest and uses an iterative<br>  procedure.<br><br>- 'sag' uses a Stochastic Average Gradient descent, and 'saga' uses<br>  its improved, unbiased version named SAGA. Both methods also use an<br>  iterative procedure, and are often faster than other solvers when<br>  both n_samples and n_features are large. Note that 'sag' and<br>  'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features with<br>  approximately the same scale. You can preprocess the data with a<br>  scaler from :mod:`sklearn.preprocessing`.<br><br>- 'lbfgs' uses L-BFGS-B algorithm implemented in<br>  :func:`scipy.optimize.minimize`. It can be used only when `positive`<br>  is True.<br><br>All solvers except 'svd' support both dense and sparse data. However, only<br>'lsqr', 'sag', 'sparse_cg', and 'lbfgs' support sparse input when<br>`fit_intercept` is True.<br><br>.. versionadded:: 0.17<br>   Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver.<br>.. versionadded:: 0.19<br>   SAGA solver.</span>\n",
